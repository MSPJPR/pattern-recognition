# pattern-recognition
This project demonstrates the implementation of a real-time pattern recognition system using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The system applies minimum distance classification and clustering techniques to classify and group data points based on their proximity to predefined centroids.

Designed for both supervised and unsupervised learning scenarios, the project serves as a simplified but practical example of how pattern recognition works in real-world applications.

Core Objectives

Implement pattern recognition techniques using only core web technologies (no external libraries or frameworks).

Provide an interactive visualization to help users understand the concepts of classification and clustering.

Showcase the feasibility of developing advanced algorithms on resource-constrained devices, such as a mobile phone.

Key Features

1. Interactive Point Classification:

Users can click on a canvas to add data points.

The system classifies these points into categories based on their distance to predefined centroids.



2. Dynamic Clustering:

The project includes an unsupervised learning approach where data points are grouped into clusters.



3. Real-Time Visualization:

Using the HTML Canvas API, the project visualizes the classification and clustering results dynamically.



4. Lightweight Implementation:

No dependencies on heavy libraries like TensorFlow or OpenCV.

Fully written in JavaScript for computational logic, with a responsive design using CSS.
